XID timing and decoding of time

Micropy - necesary for reaction time and python is doable

Several things opensource on github: pyxid

3D Printing - Laser cutting

24 bits of milliseconds

Cedrus support xid support commands

Implement XID in Adruino straight forward
	constantly pull io
	math at beginning 
	command to start test and everything be relative to that time

Verying:??
	Check system clock
	pulse a pin in sync with clock (nonstandard tweaking)
	looking at what it is think is a milli
	configure to 
	use oscilloscope measure 
	32u4s Sanbee21 (Nick preferred)
